# iOS Development Guide

## Overview

To work on Slate with iOS, we recommend using a software program on the Mac by Apple called Simulator. Simulator allows you to emulate different iOS devices and different versions of iOS on a Mac.

We do not currently have instructions on developing for iOS using Windows or Linux.

## Outline of Steps

* Installation
  * Install Xcode
* Development
  * Open Simulator
  * Disable Virtual Keyboard in Simulator
  * Open Safari
  * Enter Debug for Simulator

## Installation

### Install Xcode

Simulator is part of Xcode so you will need to install Xcode to get access to Simulator.

If you don't have Xcode installed already, install it now by following these instruction.

* From your Mac, open the **App Store**. One way to do this is to type `CMD+SPACE` to open Spotlight then type `app store`. 
* From the **App Store** window, type `xcode` in the search box near the top of the window.
* In the search results, you will see **Xcode**. Next to **Xcode**, there is a button that says **GET**. Click the button. Do not click the drop-down arrow.
* The word **GET** will change to **INSTALL APP**. Click this button.
* You will need to enter your **Apple ID** and **Password** to continue with the installation.
* The button will read **INSTALLING** during the installation process.

## Development

### Open Simulator

### Start a Device in Simulator

To start a Device:

* Click the **Hardware** menu
* Select the **Device** sub-menu
* Select the iOS version you wish to start \(try iOS 11.2 to start\)
* Select the specific device \(try iPhone 8 to start\)

After starting the device, you will see a working simulation of the device on the screen.

Open Safari on the device by clicking the Safari icon \(it's the one that looks like a compass\).

Once Safari is open, enter the URL you wish to work on. For now, try entering `slatejs.org` to visite the Slate Examples page on the Internet.
